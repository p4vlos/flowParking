//  This class has three parameters that represent the beacons positions and three parameters that
//  represent the aproximate distance from each of these beacons to the phone, running the application.
//  It's used to calculate the position of the phone through a trilateration algorithm that uses the
//  positions and distance of three beacons. The first function does the trilateration using latitude and
//  longitude positions, the second function uses positions in meters. The one that uses latitude and
//  logitude is the one currently being used in the app.
